    <h2>This delicious zucchini-boat recipe originates from one of my friends awesome minds</h2>
        <p>She basically came up with the recipe one day when we met at her place for dinner. It was so good that I imemediately had to write it down.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, as it always is, it is really hard to write down something that just popped into ones mind. But here is my take on it. Hope you enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <p><li>2x zucchini</li></p>
            <p><li>250ml tomato passata</li></p>
            <p><li>1/2 can white beans</li></p>
            <p><li>250g Rügenwalder veganes Mühlenhack</li></p>
            <p><li>2x garlic clove</li></p>
            <p><li>2x tomato</li></p>
            <p><li>1x onion</li></p>
            <p><li>2 hands of roasted almond slices</li></p>
            <p><li>Salt</li></p>
            <p><li>Pepper</li></p>
            <p><li>Ras el Hanout</li></p>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <p><li>Take two hands full of <em>almond slices</em> and roast them in a dry frying pan. Put them aside when ready.</li></p>
            <p><li>Put some oil in the frying pan and start frying the <em>Rügenwalder veganes Mühlenhack</em> on mid to high temperature.</li></p>
            <p><li>While frying the <em>Rügenwalder veganes Mühlenhack</em> cut the <em>zucchini</em> in half and with a spoon carve out the seeds and parts of the flesh so you have enough space for the filling.
                You can use the seeds and flesh for the sauce or keep it in the fridge for later use.</li></p>
            <p><li>Start cutting the remaining ingredients (<em>garlic, tomato, onion</em>) into small pieces.</li></p>
            <p><li>When the <em>veganes Mühlenhack</em> is done frying, put it aside and use the same pan to roast the onions. When they are nearly done, add the <em>garlic</em> and roast for another minute.
                finally add the tomato and the drained <em>white beans</em>.</li></p>
            <p><li>When everything is heated, add the <em>veganes Mühlenhack</em> and the roasted <em>almonds</em> and season everything to your liking with <em>salt, pepper and Ras el Hanout</em>.</li></p>
            <p><li>Now that the filling is ready, pour the <em>tomato passata</em> into a casserole dish and seaon it with <em>salt and pepper</em> before adding the <em>zucchini halfes</em>.</li></p>
            <p><li>Finally, stuff the <em>zucchini boats</em> with the filling before putting them in the preheated oven at 200-225°C.</li></p>
            <p><li>Check the consistency of the <em>zucchini</em> with a fork from time to time. When the texture is to your liking take the dish out of the oven and start plating your delicious <em>zucchini boats</em>.</li></p>
            <p><li>Enjoy this amazing food :-)</li></p>
        </ol>
