    <h2 class="h2-head">My mum's incredibly delicious Linzertorte</h2>
        <p>I honestly don't know what to say here, except: Try and be amazed ;-)</p>

    <h3 class="h3-head">Ingredients</h3>
        
    <h4 class="h4-head">For the dough</h4>
        
        <p>225g ground hazelnut</p>
        <p>200g sugar</p>
        <p>225g wheat flour</p>
        <p>225g butter</p>
        <p>2 tbsp Kirschwasser</p>
        <p>1 tsp cinnamon</p>
        <p>1 egg</p>
        <p>1 tsp drinking chocolate powder</p>
        <p>1 pinch backing powder</p>
        

    <h4 class="h4-head">For the topping</h4>
        
        <p>1 1/2 glasses raspberry jam</p>
        <p>2 eggs</p>
        

    <h3 class="h3-head">Steps</h3>
        
        <p>Mix all ingredients for the dough and knead well until you have a smooth and even consistency.</p>
        <p>Now wrap the dough in plastic wrap and put it in the refridgerator for a couple of hours.</p>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 180°C.</p>
        <p>Cut the cold dough in two halfes. Spread one half evenly inside a round springform pan and form a small edge around the sides.</p>
        <p>Now cover the cake base with the <em>raspberry jam</em>.></p>
        <p>Roll out the remaining half of the dough and cut it into stripes to lay on top of the <em>raspberry jam</em> forming a grid.</p>
        <p>Separate the egg yellow and whites and use the yellows to coat the dough grid.</p>
        <p>Put the cake in the oven and bake it at 180°C for about 35 minutes. Then turn off the heat and let the cake sit in the oven for another 7 minutes before taking it out.</p>
        <p>Let the cake cool off and you're done!</p>
        <p>Enjoy! :-)</p>
